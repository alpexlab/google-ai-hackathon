# Canceralyze
> Your Future, Our Mission: AI-Powered Cancer Detection

**Submission for Google Gen AI Hackathon 2024**

### Problem Statement (Provided by Glance) [Healthcare]

Develop an AI-powered solution that can accurately detect cancer at an early stage using specific data types such as medical images, genomic data, or electronic health records. The solution should identify high-risk patients, alert healthcare providers for further screening, and classify cancer types and stages with high accuracy. The ultimate goal is to improve cancer detection rates and enhance patient outcomes through early intervention.

### Solution

**Canceralyze** is a GenAI-powered application designed to assist doctors in the detection and treatment of cancer. It allows doctors to upload MRI scans, analyze them, and receive a probability of cancer presence. Currently, the app supports detection for three types of cancer: brain, lung, and breast. It also detects and segments tumor regions in scans related to these cancers, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

In addition, Canceralyze provides personalized treatment recommendations based on patient data. Each scan generates a comprehensive report to aid doctors in their decision-making process. The integrated GENAI chatbot offers real-time access to the latest research and treatment insights. Furthermore, a survival calculator powered by GENAI estimates patient survival rates based on specific parameters, assisting with prognosis and treatment planning.
